              <p> <span><i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i></span> Ever since my first <u>'hello world'</u>, I have been an ambitious Web Developer who takes a keen interest in all kinds of technology. With a background in Design, Development & Project Management, I am always looking to stay at the forefront of cutting-edge technology. That led me to create the Royal Technology Brand.  Royal Technology was created with the mission of <b><u>building better technology.</u></b> I take pride in my never ending curiosity and thirst for knowledge. So far I have provided 10+ years of technology consulting to clients and employers alike. I am committed to innovation and improvement for each and every one of my clients across a wide variety of technological capability. I can't imagine what life is like at the end of this journey, however, Chief Technology Officer has a nice ring to it ;)</p>
