    <p>I recently came across an awesome deal on CompTIA IT certification bundles online. I thought I would share my process (and Experience with my purchase) for anyone who is looking to get certified in the technical space. Before you decide if this is for you, lets take a look at what CompTIA is and how it could benefit anyone in the technical field.</p>
      <h5>So what is CompTIA?</h5>
<p> CompTIA stands for <u>Computing Technology Industry Association</u>, which certifies professionals in the IT field. For anyone looking to pad their resume, or break into a new field (ahem, Cyber Security), getting accredited from CompTIA <b>absolutely holds weight</b> and may even help you negotiate a raise! In short, this is absolutely worth your time! </p>

      <p>If you are interested, I have all the information listed below. <u>I must warn you the deal is set to expire this upcoming week</u> (The 17th, via the website)  </p>

<h5>So, What's the Catch?</h5>
<p>This bundle of courses is currently being offered <u>for a one-time price of $69 USD </u> via a website called <a href="https://stacksocial.com/sales/the-complete-2021-comptia-certification-training-bundle-2?utm_source=ign.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-complete-2021-comptia-certification-training-bundle&utm_term=scsf-463894&utm_content=a0x1P000004Z0F9QAK&scsonar=1&aid=a-pp33v98e" target="
  ">Stack Social.</a></p>

<p> While I must admit I haven't heard of this website prior, some reviews from <a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/stacksocial.com" target="_blank">Trust Pilot</a> and this <a href="https://www.reviewopedia.com/stacksocial-reviews" target="_blank">Blog Post</a> was enough to convince me I should risk it for the biscuit. <u>Acquiring said bundle can be confusing, so let's get into details next about what you should expect.</u> </p>

<p><b><u>Note:</u></b> It is up to you to make sure that the certificate you want to study is valid. I noticed there are 3 Security+ courses, 2 of which are old. So if you're looking to study for a security+ certificate, you should study the SY-601 course and not the SY-501 course which is old. </p>

<p>The good news is that finding the latest exam and when they are set to expire is easy peasy. You can find the latest information on the CompTIA website for comparison. Here is the <a href="https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security" target="_blank">Example for Security+</a></p>

<h5>Acquiring Said Bundle</h5>

      <p> <a href="https://stacksocial.com/sales/the-complete-2021-comptia-certification-training-bundle-2?utm_source=ign.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-complete-2021-comptia-certification-training-bundle&utm_term=scsf-463894&utm_content=a0x1P000004Z0F9QAK&scsonar=1&aid=a-pp33v98e" target="_blank"> "Stack Social" </a>is a commerce company owned by "Stack Commerce". <u>This is simply an eccommerce site and NOT where the instruction/Learning will take place.</u> The idea is that we buy our bundle on this platform and will use a redemtion voucher for where we will actually be learning.</p>

      <p>This means that after you purchase, you will follow the steps to redeem your code for another platform (<a href="https://www.icollege.co/en" target="_blank">iCollege</a>) to begin learning. Complicated, I know. </p>

      <p><u>Now you might be wondering why you wouldn't just purchase the bundle straight from iCollege to skip the middle man</u>. Well, I noticed that not only was it more expensive, but I also found a sweet way to save even more money (for First time purchasers of Stack Social).</p>

      <p>If you decide to purchase from Stack Social, <b><u>make sure to take advantage of the newsletter discount at the bottom of the website</u></b>. I simply signed up using my email and received my discount code right away. I then added the bundle to my cart to checkout. The discount code worked, bringing my total price down to <u>$62.10 USD</u> (SCORE)</p>

      <p>Once you purchase, you may go into your "Account Preferences" and unsubscribe to the newsletter you just signed up for. No Harm no foul. For what it's worth, I left my email subscribed for more awesome deals. (Using a Junk email, of course)</p>

  <h5>Getting to the Learning, Things you should know.</h5>

<p>After setting up your account on iCollege and redeeming your code from Stack Social, you are ready to go! <u>You will have all the course videos and notes on demand for your studying pleasure!</u></p>

<p>One important thing to note is that this is a platform for online learning only. So if you can't get access to the internet, you won't be able to learn. However, you are able to use your mobile, tablet and computer for your studies. </p>

<p>Another important thing to know is that this bundle <u>will not cover the cost of your exam</u>. Exam vouchers from CompTIA can be pricey (A couple hundred dollars) depending on the specific exam.</p>

<p>For questions, you can email me directly: lrivera@royaltech.io</p>

<p>Happy Learning! <br>
