    <p>I recently stumbled upon an awesome (and free) way to get certified in Microsoft Azure. I thought I would share my process for anyone who is looking to get certified in the technical space. Before you decide if this is for you, lets take a look at what azure is and how it could benefit anyone in the tech world.</p>
      <h5>So what is Azure?</h5>
<p> Azure is Microsoft’s cloud computing platform. Azure is a collection of services similar to AWS for data, storage, applications, vm’s, general data files, and much more. Azure is a cloud hosting provider that will allow a user to accomplish just about anything from machine learning, to application development. </p>

      <p>If you are interested, here in the information for getting certified in Microsoft Azure (Cloud Computing) completely free. </p>
<h5>Getting Certified - The Deets</h5>
      <p> Microsoft is currently offering a free virtual training for Microsoft Azure Fundamentals. This is a 2 day training and there are currently 3 different sets of training dates. Each day consists of ~3 hours of live virtual instruction. While instruction is virtual, microsoft specialists are live to help you with any questions you may have. The link below is the availability in February for those who want to register. </p>

" target="_blank"> Microsoft Azure Fundamentals -- Registration</a></p>

<p>For attending the training you will be credited with a <b><u>free voucher</u></b> to take the Certification Exam, which makes this an <b><u>entirely free certification program</u></b>. For those working in technology already, this program builds on your security plus foundation, adding cloud computing concepts as well. This course is comparable to Microsoft’s version of AWS fundamentals.</p>

<p>Once you choose your dates and register, you will receive an email containing your personal link to join the virtual training.

<p><b><u>Important Note: All training times listed are in GMT +01:00 Timezone. Make sure you know the equivalent EST time for when your training will take place. Instruction is also delivered in English.</u></b></p>

<p>Once you finished the training, your instructors will send you instructions for taking your free certification exam in the live chat.

<p>Should you want to learn all the topics on your own and schedule the exam, you can use the link below. However, you must attend a training to receive your free exam voucher.</p>

<h5>Recommended studying and Exam Scheduling</h5>

<p>Microsoft makes sure to note that you will be given instructions to schedule your free exam once you are finished with the virtual training. <b><u>The voucher is credited to your microsoft account after 5 days.</u></b> This means you have to wait a couple of days before you can officially schedule your exam. While you are waiting, they also recommend to complete all the azure learning resources from microsoft with the knowledge checks. This will make sure you are ready to take on the exam.</p>
