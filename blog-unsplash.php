    <p>I wanted to take the time to share a resource that <u>I personally have been using for a long time</u> that has helped me with just about every single one of my Web and Graphic Design-based projects. Unsplash. Let's talk more about it and how it can help you.</p>
      <h5>So what is Unsplash?</h5>
<p> Unsplash is a website that offers free, high-resolution photos from photographers all around the world. Instead of fumbling for image licensing, or worse, taking images off google, this is a great way of confidently knowing your assets online are free to use! </p>

    <h5>What' the catch?</h5>
      <p>Unsplash allows users to simply head over to the website and start searching for any image they want to use! If you are a photographer, unsplash lets you create accounts and contribute to it's massive image library. However, this is totally optional. Simply use the URL below and start searching for images. When you find one you like, there is a green download button in the top right of the webpage for you to save. Voila!</p>
<p><a href="https://unsplash.com/" target="_blank">https://unsplash.com/</a></p>

<h5>Why is this useful?</h5>
      <p><u>If you are a developer or designer in any capacity, having access to free imagery is always a win</u>. You can use it for inspiration or utilize images in your design material. Product design such as signs, brochures, and magazines, or Digital Design such as background images and slideshow images make this website a super handy, worry-free way of displaying great resolution photos. </p>
<p>If you are ever stuck and need some ideas (or pictures), definitely bookmark this site to visit when you're in a pinch.</p>
