      <p>This is the 4H chart on bitcoin. It could potentially be giving us some clues in the near term in regards to movement. You can see that the price is just bouncing back and forth at weird ranges. However, the RSI is weak and we don’t currently have much strength. This leads me to believe the SMA 100 is the only reason btc is being propped up. If we see some weakness and break below this today, we can expect a further pullback to 28000. <b><u>This is actually what i’m currently partial to. We need to see more strength in a bounce to determine a decent supply zone.</u></b>
      </p>

      <p>
        Sentiment: currently holding 76% position. I offloaded 24% with this pullback being expected. Next targets for potential offloading are 50k. Considering a 9% holdings offload to make it a clean 33%
      </p>

      <p>
How i would trade: I’m on the sidelines targeting 28,000. To continue marching forward, we need to regain the sma 50 on the 4H (36,000) and the RSI needs to hold above 50 to show some kind of strength.

      <p>This is the 4H chart of Ethereum. After a couple of red candles, we see consolidation here. Again the RSI looks like crap and <b><u>im leaning toward a breakdown in price. If we see a breakdown our next targets are 976, 916.</u></b> I’m still fishing for the 916 level. If we hold there twice it would be a really good sign of it being a major supply zone.</p>

      <p>Sentiment: bearish short term, bullish mid term</p>

      <p>How I would trade: I would still fish for coins around the 915 level. A double test and hold is a good sign the crypto market just needed consolidation to cool off.</p>

      <p>
This is the 4H chart of ltc/usd. At first glimpse it would look like We are fighting with a resistance at 138.65. However, i think this looks like a bear flag continuation pattern. We need to watch closely for a break of this triangle to determine next move. To the downside we seem to be supported by 124 price range. If we break to the upside we are targeting 158.82
      </p>

      <p>Sentiment: Swing Long, currently holding</p>

      <p>How i would trade: need a convincing break of the 138.65 level or go fishing between 110-120 price point for entry

      <p>
        This is the daily chart of OMG zoomed in. It is still very much fighting and clawing its way through each resistance and support. Looks ugly but I am still bullish once this triangle breaks. The plan remains the same to try and fish the 2.51 price. Expect a trading range of 3.00 to 3.84 until this decides which way it wants to break.
</p>

      <p>Sentiment: Still bullish long term, but not immediately  until we can breakout of this triangle
</p>

      <p>How i would trade: Enter a position around the 2.51 price point so long as it holds with a tight stop loss. RSI is neutral so the market has yet to decide its next move

      <p>
      This is the daily chart of ripple. It STILL looks like shit to be honest. The only saving grace was the last major support zone. RSI is looking better with the mini breakout, giving it strength. Still in the weeds. </p>

      <p>Sentiment: short term bearish mid term bearish
</p>

      <p>How to trade: Ripple lawsuit is making this trade complicated. <b><u>If not already in, would not enter. Exchanges are delisting this coin and coinbase is no longer trading this coin after the 19th of january. Would not advise entry unless scalping for intraday gains.</u></b>

      <a href="../img/crypto-updates/eth-btc.PNG" target="_blank"/><img src="../img/crypto-updates/eth-btc.PNG" alt="Ethereum / Bitcoin Chart" class="img-thumbnail d-xs-block img-fluid" style="margin: 10px 0px 10px 0px;"></a>

      <p>
      ETH/BTC has been suppressed and trading inside a pennant on the weekly dating back to may 2018. Currently facing resistance at .0332. <u>Breaking above this resistance will see ethereum make gains faster relative to bitcoin. </u> A Breakout will reach the first major resistance at .043. This chart is the key to the ethereum price In the mid term.
     </p>

      <p>Another rejection of the triangle is keeping ethereum suppressed in relation to btc. RSI is below 50 which is trending neutral / bearish. It seems to be desperately holding onto a support zone. Good entries for ethereum are when this triangle breaks out. Partial to a drop here to .029 <b><u>STILL MEGA BULLISH MID TERM </u></b>

</p>

      <p><b><u>Note: Remember. The more suppressed this ratio is, the faster bitcoin will gain on alts. Vice Versa is true. Once this breaks out, ethereum will lead alts to the moon!</u></b>
</p>

<p>Sentiment: near term bearish, mid term mega bullish</p>

<p>How to trade: if breakout, wait for a successful backtest to enter, which is the .0336 level. If pullback, wait for the support zones for entry. .030, .0299 to enter. Once we break the pennant, we are bullish and ethereum will be off to the races!

      <p>
    It looks like the amazon pennant is breaking down with a target of ~2920. I believe the moving average at 2920 is a good price to buy! Unless we can move back into the pennant quickly, I would wait for sub 3,000’s to enter. <b><u>Now our support at 3141 has turned into a resistance.</u></b> </p>

      <p>Bullish scenario: last 2 earnings beat expectations heavily, the pandemic has forced more online shopping. Amazon broke records for earnings on the holiday season

</p>

      <p>Bearish: Democratic controlled senate and white house may cause fear of taxation and may move the market.
</p>

<p>Sentiment: near term bearish, mid term mega bullish</p>

<p>How to trade: look for entry around 2920 unless we can move back into this pennant and above the moving averages. <b><u>More patience is needed for this trade.</u></b>

      <p>
        This is the weekly chart of Diageo. Technically speaking, it looks pretty good. All technicals and oscillators are point to buy. RSI looks good. We are above the key moving averages which is also bullish. <b><u>It looks like a  test of 174.55 is coming up, which is all time high. </u></b> A break above this would be a good sign for entry!
</p>

      <p>Sentiment: short term bullish mid term neutral

</p>

      <p>Bearish case: 2020 profits, revenue, and net income have slipped for diageo with the pandemic affecting almost every major company.
</p>

<p>How to trade: I would be on the sidelines here until we can break All time high or we can fill the gap below. Should we lose 159 price point, we can expect a slide down to 153, 151, 145. If we hit 142-145 range that would make sense to fill the gap and retreat to major support zones.
</p>

<p>I will pick up a half position if we can break all time high or retreat back to 145. </p>
