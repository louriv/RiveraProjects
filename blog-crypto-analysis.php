      <p>This is the daily chart of BTC/USD. The SMA10 held surprisingly well and we broke upward overnight. We pushed past the resistance at 34k. That is the level we want to hold going forward. Should we do so, another test of 38k is incoming. Once support settles, I expect it to come in one quick move. Ultimately, if we can hold supports we are looking to retest ATH in the 40-42k range.</p>
<p>
        Sentiment: currently holding 76% position. I offloaded 24% at 39k. Next target is 50k. Considering a 9% holdings offload at 50k to make it a clean 33%
</p>

      <p>
      How I would trade: entries close to 34k followed by a tight stop below 31200. The SMA 50 has proven its value and if we fall below that i would change sentiment to bearish. </p>

      <p>Here is today’s ethereum chart. Ethereum is so close to price discovery mode it’s not even funny. The RSI experienced a breakout upward and looks good. The only thing holding us back is the sma 200 on the ETH/BTC chart. We get closer to running every day. Stay patient on this trade.
</p>

      <p>The biggest takeaway from this coin is that we can observe multiple rejections at the 1400 resistance. However, each resistance is eating the sellers as each rejection is getting weaker. Our goal is to stay above the sma10. Another attack on 1400 might do it, folks.</p>

      <p>Sentiment: bullish </p>

      <p>How I would trade: Buy the breakout on the sma 200 and ride the wave. See eth/btc.

        Here is the daily chart on litecoin. Litecoin still has yet to invalidate an elliott wave 5 count. It also looks to be breaking above the descending channel. As expected we got a bounce in litecoin with it sitting at critical support on the ltc/btc chart. This little guy is still my favorite out of the 3. Although ethereum is closest to actually launching the rocket pad, this coin value relative to bitcoin hasn’t been this low since the 2017 crash. We need to give it some more time for some fireworks, folks. See ltc/btc

      <p>Sentiment: Swing Long, currently holding</p>

      <p>How i would trade: HODL

        Omg has been on an absolute tear lately ripping higher. RSI resistance seems to be holding back more gains. The 3.84 level seems to be holding (For now). I don’t have much confidence at that support with the volatility as this coin. I’m still bullish on this coin. My play would be to fish at the sma 10 (3.57 for entry)
</p>

      <p>Sentiment: neutral
</p>

      <p>How i would trade: Look for entry around 3.57

      <p>
        Although xrp has been looking crazy lately, I don’t think anything out of the ordinary is happening. I’m looking at this coin as a mega breakout followed by a backtest of the moving averages which had it suppressed for so long. Not sure how the lawsuit noise is playing into this, but technically speaking, I'm hopping over to the bullish side of the force.
</p>

      <p>Sentiment: Bullish
</p>

      <p>How to trade: Ripple lawsuit is making this trade complicated. <b><u>Coinbase is no longer allowing trades on XRP.

        The sma 200 is an absolute beast and the only reason ethereum isn’t running to the moon. (0.043) A big wick means we are very well supported at the .037 and .038 levels. I like ethereum in the middle term. We are fighting to get above the sma10. That is the first obstacle. If we can do so, we attack the sma 200 again. We also may be showing a breakout of the downtrend line since we first touched that crucial moving average. More to come
</p>



      <p><b><u>Note: Remember. The more suppressed this ratio is, the faster bitcoin will gain on alts. Vice Versa is true. Once this breaks out, ethereum will lead alts to the moon!</u></b>

        Here is the litecoin/bitcoin ratio chart. Litecoin got a much needed bounce from the support ratio price as well as the RSI. We are currently even above the sma10. Make no mistake about this. We are absolutely bearish until we can get above the moving averages. However, I like to buy the doom. Remember, the last time litecoin was this suppressed against bitcoin was after the 2017 crash. Technically speaking, there is more room below for another hit ~20%. However I decided to buy all the way down should that be the case. I think we are locking in the bottom before a moon landing.

    Amazon found a nice support about retesting the sma supports and took off like a rocket . We are now testing a resistance at 3400. If we break we run, baby! I like amazon and think after 6 months of consolidation were getting ready for a Rip & Run rally</p>


<p>Sentiment: near term bullish, mid term mega bullish</p>

<p>How to trade: never buy at resistance. Only supports

On the daily diageo found support and is heading up to test the top end of the channel. I am still looking to get above the 174 for entry on this coin in case the channel breaks down.</p>

      <p>Sentiment: neutral

<p>How to trade: <b><u>I would be on the sidelines here until we can break All time high</u></b> or we can fill the gap below.
</p>

<p>I will pick up a half position if we can break all time high or retreat back to 145. </p>
