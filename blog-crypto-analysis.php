      <p>We experienced a crazy weekend in regards to the bitcoin movement. We broke out of the channel and took off like a rocket toward the newly created resistance at 38,100. (This seemed to coincide with the elon musk tweet). Regardless of whatever you believe, the wick rejected and we came back to earth for what seemed like more consolidation. However, more sideways action isn’t a bad thing in this situation. We are being propped up by the sma10 and consolidating for what looks like a break of the 34k level. Getting a daily close above here would put our next target back into the 38k region. I’m leaning bullish on a break upward.
</p>
<p>
        Sentiment: currently holding 76% position. I offloaded 24% at 39k. Next target is 50k. Considering a 9% holdings offload at 50k to make it a clean 33%

      <p>Here is today’s ethereum chart. One thing I wanted to highlight about this chart is the RSI. While ethereum seems to consolidate here, we are noticing solid attempts to push up while the RSI continues to consolidate in what looks like a descending trend line, which is capping the volatility of the coin. It’s time to put this coin on watch. The RSI is back in the neutral (ish) area and an RSI breakout is suggesting a big move on the coin (that could be up or down but I am leaning bullish on this coin as well)</p>

      <p>The biggest takeaway from this coin is that we can observe multiple rejections at the 1400 resistance. However, each resistance is eating the sellers as each rejection is getting weaker. Our goal is to get above the sma10. Another attack on 1400 might do it, folks.</p>

      <p>Sentiment: bullish </p>

      <p>How I would trade: added another coin here at the 1280ish level

      Litecoin is looking the most bearish out of the big 3 coins. It is notably below the sma 10 as well as the sma 50. The litecoin ratio in comparison to btc is still super suppressed. If you think crypto is still bullish in the mid term, this would bring the best value buy.

        OMG had a quick run followed by another big wick. Still in the weeds but bullish overall. If we can find our way above 4.46 we are going to rip higher.

      <p>
        Ripple was the most interesting coin of the weekend absolutely ripping all the way to the .70 cent level prior to coming back down. Clear RSI breakout and what looks like a backtest as well. Dare I say, leaning bullish?
</p>

      <p>Sentiment: Bullish?

      <p>How to trade: Ripple lawsuit is making this trade complicated. <b><u>Coinbase is no longer allowing trades on XRP.

        The sma 200 is an absolute beast and the only reason ethereum isn’t running to the moon. A big wick means we are very well supported at the .037 level. I like ethereum in the middle term. However, we need to get back above the sma10 and the resistance line to gain mega bullish sentiment. Right now as long as we hold .038 and .037 levels, I’m liking ether. I’m also looking for opportunities to add.
</p>



      <p><b><u>Note: Remember. The more suppressed this ratio is, the faster bitcoin will gain on alts. Vice Versa is true. Once this breaks out, ethereum will lead alts to the moon!</u></b>

      <p>
        The litecoin bitcoin chart looks like absolute shit. However as stated before i’m buying the doom as I don’t believe we can go much lower from here. The only thing that this chart has going for it is a potential double bottom on the ratio.

      Amazon looks to be retracing but i think personally it’s building a nice support base for takeoff. I'm bullish on this coin as long as the bottom of the pennant and sma 10 hold nicely.</p>


<p>Sentiment: near term bullish, mid term mega bullish</p>

  On the weekly deo tested the sma 100 and bounced rather nicely. The RSI looks good and we are still trading in the channel. I personally would still like to see a break with a clear direction before I initiate any trades.</p>

      <p>Sentiment: neutral

</p>



<p>How to trade: <b><u>I would be on the sidelines here until we can break All time high</u></b> or we can fill the gap below. Should we lose 159 price point, we can expect a slide down to 153, 151, 145. If we hit 142-145 range that would make sense to fill the gap and retreat to major support zones.
</p>

<p>I will pick up a half position if we can break all time high or retreat back to 145. </p>
