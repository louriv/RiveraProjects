      <p>
        Here I have zoomed in, daily chart of bitcoin. We had what isn’t a *breakdown* overnight but rather a test of the daily moving average support. ASs long as the ma9 and sma10 hold, we are bullish. It’s important to note that some exchanges saw a 50k test and rejected it. Coinbase did not see a test of 50k before it slipped. Either way this downslide is considered minor so far and got bought up quickly. Nothing is concerning with bitty yet but it’s important we keep an eye out for another push up to 50k</p>


<p>
        Sentiment: currently holding 76% position. I offloaded 24% at 39k. Next target is 50k. Considering a 9% holdings offload at 50k to make it a clean 33%
</p>

      <p>
      How I would trade: HODL and ride the wave. Offload some at 50k if you dont have a high risk tolerance. just make sure to keep some. </p>

      <p>The channel is still in play on the ethereum daily. It looks like ethereum did experience a false breakdown of the ma9 and sma10. As the moving averages converge with the top of the channel, that means we have a big move coming around the corner. A breakdown of the ma9 and sma10 would give a target of 1532. That a good buy zone should we get there. The other option is the moving averages to squeeze ethereum above the top channel. Then we should see a quick test of the big 2k zone. </p>


      <p>Sentiment: bullish </p>

      <p>
        Litecoin has had an incredible week gaining about $70 / coin in the last 7 days. This little guy looks pooped for the time being. I expect some sideways consolidation while the RSI has a chance to cool off. The moving averages held well which is a good sign for future bullishness. Another thing to note is that the elliott wave played out nicely and was completed. We saw a little rejection of the ~220 region which was expected. Buy the dips.
</p>

      <p>Sentiment: Swing Long, currently holding</p>

      <p>How i would trade: accumulate, regardless of short term price.

      <p>
        OMG experienced really intense growth and saw a likewise intense pullback. I expect this coin to consolidate its gains prior to a push toward the 8.5 region.

      <p>
        XRP found a newly created resistance at the .63 mark and saw a retreat just like the rest of the market. Still bullish.
</p>

      <p>Sentiment: Bullish
</p>

      <p>How to trade: Ripple lawsuit is making this trade complicated. <b><u>Coinbase is no longer allowing trades on XRP.

      <p>

        Eth/BTC is still trying to find it’s footing. Holding support at .037 is a start. I would imagine another attack on the SMA 200 on the horizon.
</p>



      <p><b><u>Note: Remember. The more suppressed this ratio is, the faster bitcoin will gain on alts. Vice Versa is true. Once this breaks out, ethereum will lead alts to the moon!</u></b>

      <p>
        LTC/BTC ratio is still well within the triangle. The longer we hover down here, the more we form a nice base for a runup in the medium term. The litecoin price has done well against the usd pair recently, but in the long term, we are going way higher once we break above this triangle upward.

      <p>

    Amazon found a nice support about retesting the sma supports and took off like a rocket . We are now testing a resistance at 3400. If we break we run, baby! I like amazon and think after 6 months of consolidation were getting ready for a Rip & Run rally</p>


<p>Sentiment: near term bullish, mid term mega bullish</p>

<p>How to trade: never buy at resistance. Only supports

On the daily diageo found support and is heading up to test the top end of the channel. I am still looking to get above the 174 for entry on this coin in case the channel breaks down.</p>

      <p>Sentiment: neutral

</p>



<p>How to trade: <b><u>I would be on the sidelines here until we can break All time high</u></b> or we can fill the gap below.
</p>

<p>I will pick up a half position if we can break all time high or retreat back to 145. </p>
