As a classmate, his work ethic was something to be admired and his work was always top quality. He was open to new ideas and there if I ever needed advice or inspiration, of which he was happy to give. After school, he was quick to share his experiences, to the point that he would even invite me along whenever possible to see the impressive stuff he was working on for clients. He's a talented designer, a dedicated worker, and a spectacular friend.</p>

Louis is extremely passionate about everything he does, and I am always impressed not only by his ability to juggle multiple roles (attending grad school while working full time), but also by the amount of care and effort he puts into each new undertaking. He takes the time to learn every aspect of his craft in detail, and the result is clearly reflected in his work.</p>
